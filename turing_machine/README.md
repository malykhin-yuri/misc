Turing machine (TM) is the most-known model of computation.
Here I collected some programs about TM:
* [turing_machine](turing_machine.py)
    simple class that emulates TM
* [multitape](multitape.py)
    Multitape Turing machine (MTM) and TM emulator for MTM
* [binarize](binarize.py)
    convert machine with any finite alphabet to {0,1}-alphabet
* [universal](universal.py)
    Universal TM (UTM) implemented as MTM for binary TM's
* [tests](tests.py)
    various tests, see [log](run.log)
