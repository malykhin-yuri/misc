Turing machine (TM) is the most-known model of computation.
Here I collected some programs about them:
* turing_machine.py 
    simple class that emulates TM
* patches.py
    allows to shorten definition of TM rules
* binarize.py
    convert machine with any finite alphabet to {0,1}-alphabet
* universal.py
    Universal TM (work in progress)
* tests.py
    some tests
